    <p> What Is an 'About Us' Page? In short, it's a page that can inspire people to work with you or buy your products. 
        It can contain
        (but isn't limited to containing) your brand story, your achievements, and your best testimonials. 
        An About page is not a place to push a hard sell or boast about your business.</p>
